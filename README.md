🎬 Movie Sentiment Analyzer (ML + DL + Streamlit)

This project analyzes the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews using both traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches, and exposes the results through a Streamlit web app.

🔹 Features

Baseline ML Model: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (fast, interpretable).

Deep Learning Model: LSTM neural network trained on tokenized reviews.

Interactive UI: Streamlit app where users can enter a movie review and instantly see predictions from both models.

Comparison: Check how classical ML and modern DL agree or differ on the same review.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

NLTK for text preprocessing

Streamlit for the front-end

Joblib for saving/loading ML models

🔹 User Flow

Type a review (e.g., “The movie was boring and way too long”).

Get predictions from:

🤖 ML (Logistic Regression) → Negative

🧠 DL (LSTM) → Negative

See if the models agree or disagree.

🔹 Why this project matters

Demonstrates the difference between classical ML and DL in NLP.

Real-world application: movie review sentiment analysis.

Beginner-friendly, yet advanced enough to showcase end-to-end ML + DL + UI integration.
